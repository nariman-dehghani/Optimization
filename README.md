# Optimization
A metaheuristic algorithm for solving constrained optimization with binary variables. 


This code is the main part of the BICDE algorithm, which is developed via the integration of a binary differential evolutionary (BDE) algorithm with the improved (μ+λ)-constrained differential evolution (ICDE). The BICDE has the capability of the ICDE to solve constrained optimization problems and features of the BDE algorithm to handle nonlinear, non-differentiable, and multi-modal objective functions with binary decision variables.
