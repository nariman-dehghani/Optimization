# Optimization

This repository contains codes for optimization. The description of each code is explained below:

# BICDE.py
A metaheuristic algorithm for constrained optimization problems with binary variables.
This code is the main part of the BICDE algorithm, which is developed via the integration of a binary differential evolutionary (BDE) algorithm with the improved (μ+λ)-constrained differential evolution (ICDE). The BICDE has the capability of the ICDE to solve constrained optimization problems and features of the BDE algorithm to handle nonlinear, non-differentiable, and multi-modal objective functions with binary decision variables. 
Details on this algorithm can be find in the following book chapter:
    "Evolutionary Optimization for Resilience-Based Planning for Power Distribution Networks"

# RAP.py
This is a simple example for LP formulation with Gurobi-Python
This problem is called Resource Assignment Problem (RAP). 
This code is entirely based on the following link:
